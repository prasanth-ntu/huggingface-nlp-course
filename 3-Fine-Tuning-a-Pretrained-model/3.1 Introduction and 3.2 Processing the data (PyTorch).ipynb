    "> \n",
    "> 1. <b>Masked Language Modeling (MLM)</b>: In this task, BERT is trained to predict randomly masked words in a sentence. During training, a certain percentage of the input tokens are replaced with a special [MASK] token, and the model is tasked with predicting the original tokens based on the context provided by the surrounding unmasked tokens. This encourages the model to learn bidirectional contextual representations of words in a sentence.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. <b>Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)</b>: In this task, BERT is trained to predict whether a given sentence follows another sentence. The model is provided with pairs of sentences and learns to classify whether the second sentence is a logical continuation of the first one or not. This helps the model to learn relationships between sentences and capture a broader understanding of the text.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By pre-training BERT on these two tasks, the model learns a rich understanding of the language, including syntax, semantics, and context. Once pre-trained, BERT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, question-answering, and more, with relatively small amounts of labeled data. This process of fine-tuning allows BERT to leverage its pre-trained knowledge and adapt to the specific task at hand, often resulting in state-of-the-art performance."

Note that it also works if the example dictionary contains several samples (each key as a list of sentences) since the `tokenizer` works on lists of pairs of sentences, as seen before. This will allow us to use the option `batched=True` in our call to `map()`, which will greatly speed up the tokenization. The tokenizer is backed by a tokenizer written in Rust from the 🤗 Tokenizers library. This tokenizer can be very fast, but only if we give it lots of inputs at once.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">Note that we’ve left the `padding` argument out in our tokenization function for now</span>. <span style=\"color:red\">This is because padding all the samples to the maximum length is not efficient</span>: <span style=\"color:green\">it’s better to pad the samples when we’re building a batch, as then we only need to pad to the maximum length in that batch, and not the maximum length in the entire dataset.
