By the end of this part of the course, you will be familiar with how Transformer models work and will know how to use a model from the Hugging Face Hub, fine-tune it on a dataset, and share your results on the Hub!\n",

Along the way, youâ€™ll learn how to build and share demos of your models, and optimize them for production environments. By the end of this part, you will be ready to apply ðŸ¤— Transformers to (almost) any machine learning problem!"
